# Splunk Challenge: Hands-On SIEM Investigation

## Overview

This repository documents a 7-day hands-on challenge from [HAX Security Courses](https://learn.haxsecurity.com/). The course is designed to build and test security operations (SecOps) skills using Splunk as a SIEM. The challenge simulates common attack techniques and defensive strategies across endpoint monitoring, network intrusion detection, and firewall log analysis. I have configured a home lab with data sources, log forwarding, rule-based detection, and dashboard building.

## Challenge Coverage

- Splunk deployment and log ingestion
- Windows RDP brute-force detection using Sysmon
- Detection of PowerShell abuse and malware download attempts
- File integrity monitoring using Auditd on Linux
- Suricata-based network intrusion detection
- Analysis of Palo Alto firewall logs
- Dashboard and alert creation in Splunk
